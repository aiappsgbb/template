# IP Compliance Assessment

Perform a comprehensive compliance assessment of the repository to ensure it meets Azure Developer CLI template standards and is production-ready for deployment.

## Overview

This assessment covers multiple compliance areas:
- ‚úÖ **IP Metadata Compliance**: Validates ip-metadata.json against schema
- ‚úÖ **Repository Structure**: Ensures proper folder organization and required files
- ‚úÖ **Azure Developer CLI Configuration**: Validates azure.yaml completeness
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure as Code**: Checks Bicep templates and parameters
- ‚úÖ **Deployment Readiness**: Verifies the repository can be deployed via `azd up`
- ‚úÖ **Security & Best Practices**: Reviews security configurations and standards
- ‚úÖ **Documentation Quality**: Ensures comprehensive documentation

## Compliance Checks
